          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>
            Regenerative braking system is an energy recovery system that helps to slow down a vehicle by converting its kinetic energy into any other forms of energy including chemical energy, rotational kinetic energy and electric energy that would be stored in an energy device. The energy recovery system concept has been widely used in today’s modern world; for instance, Formula-1 cars utilized flywheel or high voltage batteries to store and to recover a moving F-1 cars’ kinematic energy under braking (ref). EcoBoost Team aimed to apply the magic of the regenerative braking concept on a bicycle to store part of the braking capacity in a 9 kg flywheel for later use in propelling riders’ bicycle when starting and to improve the bicycle performance. The great engineering behind the regenerative braking system will help the rider to save riders’ pedal energy by boosting the starting the starting acceleration of the bicycle during a ride. EcoBoost Team designed the regenerative braking system with several important machine elements which were sprockets, chain, bearings, cone clutch, planetary gear, compression springs (absorber), extension spring, and flywheel. 
            The process of EcoBoost’s regenerative braking system has two stages which are energy storing stage and energy release stage. During the energy storing stage, the flywheel sprocket was driven by the rear wheel sprocket with the flywheel; energy storing phase began after the brake cable was pulled, and the kinetic energy was transfer from the rear wheel to the flywheel through actuated cone clutch and planetary gear that helped to increase rotational speed of the flywheel. The maximum energy that could be stored in flywheel in 3.8617 kJ. During the energy release stage, the rider was required to press a control button to kick-start the bicycle at a certain speed from rest to allow the transferring of rotational kinetic energy from the flywheel to the rear wheel through planetary gear, cone clutch, flywheel sprocket, chain, and rear wheel sprocket. The output kinetic energy from the flywheel to the rear after undergoing energy release and clutch friction process was calculated to be 0.82656 kJ, which corresponds to the overall brake energy regeneration efficiency of 12.17 %, thus boosting the bicycle to start from 0 to 16.9934 km/h without exerting pedal force from the cyclist after the last braking cycle (assumed that the initial bicycle speed before the regenerative breaking process is 40 km/h). The Regenerative Project Write-up will further discuss about the overall design layout and description, energy sizing, storage, and system level engineering, detailed design of the energy storage element, detailed design of energy storage drivetrain and system, conclusion, and lesson learned from EcoBoost Team.
